Set up and use MLflow to track machine learning experiments, compare model performances, and manage experiment metadata.

Data Preparation:
    Boston Housing dataset was used
    Dataframe was divided into input as numerical features and output as Median value of owner-occupied homes in $1000
    For each model data was divided into 80% training and 20% test data

Linear Regression Model:
    Linear Regression model was trained
    Performance was evaluated\

Random Forest Model:
    Random model was trained
    Performance was evaluated
    
ML Flow:
    Both Model were tracked and logged
    Performance metrices were logged
    Best Model was registered
